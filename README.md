My Keyboard Maestro macros.

## The macros

### Convert To Windows Line Endings

Converts the currently selected Finder files to use Windows line endings (CRLF) instead 
of Unix (LF) or classic Mac (CR). It skips files without a recognized text filename 
extension. The list of recognized extensions can be modified in the macro. To turn this
into a "Convert To Unix Line Endings" macro, change the filter used in the "Filter 
Variable ‘curr_file_content_new’ with Windows Line Endings" action.

### Zip Folder

Zips the selected folder(s) without including hidden files and folders (`.DS_Store`, 
`_MACOSX`). Very handy for sharing with people running Windows.

## The rest

### Disclaimer

Use these macros at your own risk.
